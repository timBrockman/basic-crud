  - [ ] config file for api key stuff (more github friendly)
  - [ ] consider mongolabs or mongohq in addition to local
  - [ ] consider some authz & authn (passport and something mongo)
  - [ ] consider breaking route operations (and maybe helpers) out
  - [ ] separate router and app level middleware
  - [x] breakup into require module.exports

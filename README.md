# q/d express + mongoskin RESTful api project
this is still raw..

## todo:
  - [ ] share on github for easy access
  - [ ] everything but failing tests
  - [ ] a little extra validation or formatting
  - [ ] better organization (more named functions, less banana)
  - [ ] consider using config file for db and api key stuff (more github friendly)
  - [ ] consider mongolabs or mongohq in addition to local

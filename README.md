# q/d express + mongoskin RESTful api project
this is still raw.. 
  I lost my train of thought.. refreshing the require/module.exports for more 
  module based structure vs. the usual by type some times organization strategy  
  .then I wrote a short paper and ate some ham and easter candy
  it seems like I wanted to experiment with some more stuff 
  .. something related to required functions being passed to other required functions 
  probably to keep my routes and all the set crap organized
  at any rate all tests are passing for monolithic chain of bananas form

## todo:
  - [x] share on github for easy access
  - [x] all 6 tests pass
  - [ ] start refactoring
  - [ ] a little extra validation or formatting
  - [ ] better organization (more named functions, less banana)
  - [x] consider using config file for db 
  - [ ] config file for api key stuff (more github friendly)
  - [ ] consider mongolabs or mongohq in addition to local
